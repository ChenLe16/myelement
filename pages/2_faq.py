### ❓ What is this tool based on?
This tool is built on time-based elemental mapping systems rooted in classical Eastern philosophies. By analyzing your birth data (date and time), we identify which natural elements—Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth—are most influential in shaping your behavior, decisions, and tendencies.

---

### ❓ Do I need to know my exact birth time?
Knowing your exact birth time helps improve the accuracy of your result, especially in areas like emotional tendencies and long-term traits. If you don’t know the exact time, the results will still be informative—but may be slightly generalized.

---

### ❓ What does the Star Meter mean?
The Star Meter shows how strongly each of the five natural elements influences your personality. A higher star rating means that element plays a bigger role in your traits and decision-making style.

---

### ❓ How is this different from astrology or MBTI?
This system is based on a logical framework of time, patterns, and elemental interactions. It's neither predictive astrology nor a Western psychological test. Instead, it's an interpretive model for self-awareness and life alignment.

---

### ❓ Is this a personality test?
Not in the traditional sense. It’s not based on answers to quiz questions, but on fixed data from your birth. Think of it as a mirror—showing potential patterns based on nature’s timing and rhythm.

---

### ❓ What can I use this for?
You can use your result to better understand your personality, improve decision-making, explore career directions, and reflect on your relationship style. Some people also use it for journaling, coaching, or team building.

---

### ❓ Do you store my data?
We only use your birth data to calculate your result. We do not store, share, or sell your information.

---

### ❓ Can I get a more detailed breakdown?
Yes! We regularly release new blog posts explaining different aspects of your result in more depth. You can also subscribe to get updates or request a personalized version if you're interested.
